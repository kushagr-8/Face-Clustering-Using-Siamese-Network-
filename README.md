# Face-Clustering-Using-Siamese-Network-
Developed a model for grouping similar faces using  techniques from deep learning and computer vision.With a carefully curated custom dataset of 300 images, my model's primary focus was on extracting distinctive facial features. To achieve this, I designed a powerful Siamese network, which excelled at feature extraction for both single and multiple faces in an image.To further enhance accuracy, I integrated the FaceNet pretrained model and leveraged YOLOV8 and MTCNN detectors for precise facial embeddings. These embeddings were then passed through the FaceNet model, providing even better results for single faces. One exciting observation was that the FaceNet model, though exceptional for single faces, encountered challenges with multiple faces. In contrast, the Siamese network demonstrated superior performance for both scenarios, leading to more robust and reliable clustering results.This project exemplifies the potential of combining state-of-the-art deep learning and computer vision techniques for practical applications like facial recognition and clustering. I'm thrilled with the outcomes and eager to explore even more groundbreaking solutions in the field of AI.
